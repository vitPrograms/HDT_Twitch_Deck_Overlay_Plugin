# TwitchDeckOverlay

## Overview

**TwitchDeckOverlay** is a plugin for Hearthstone Deck Tracker (HDT) that allows players and streamers to view Hearthstone decks shared in Twitch chat directly in-game via an overlay. The plugin automatically parses deck codes from Twitch chat messages and displays them in a convenient interface where you can view deck details, copy deck codes, or remove decks from the list.

This plugin is perfect for:
- **Hearthstone streamers** who want to quickly view decks shared by their audience.
- **Players** watching streams who want to try out decks posted in chat.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The plugin currently uses fixed UI sizes, so it works best at a resolution of 1920x1080. On other resolutions (e.g., 2560x1440 or 4K), UI elements may appear too small, too large, or extend beyond the screen.

## Known Issues

- **Fixed UI Sizes**:
  - The plugin is designed with fixed sizes (width: 350 pixels, max height: 600 pixels), so it works best at 1920x1080 resolution.
  - On 2K (2560x1440) or 4K (3840x2160) screens, text and elements may appear too small or too large, and popups may extend beyond the screen.
  - Adaptive scaling is planned for future updates.
- **Popup Positioning**:
  - If the overlay is near the right edge of the screen, popups (card images, Hero Power) may partially go off-screen.
- **Windows Scaling**:
  - On displays with Windows scaling (e.g., 150%), some elements may appear disproportionate.

If you experience display issues, try:
1. Changing your screen resolution to 1920x1080.
2. Setting Windows scaling to 100%.
3. Moving the overlay closer to the center of the screen.
